        <h2>What is Bluesky</h2>
        <p>Bluesky or bsky.app is a social media platform like Twitter or Threads but not owned by some billionaire or some massive tech company. Bluesky started as a start-up then became one of the biggest social media platforms with its awesome moderation and its “nice” community of 3.2 million users (about the population of Arkansas).</p>
        <h2>Why not Threads or Twitter</h2>
        <p>The problem with Threads and Twitter is the company's there developed by. Threads by Meta and Twitter now owned by Elon Musk. Twitter for example Published in the journal Communications Psychology, the study found that, while logging onto X led to a greater sense of belonging for some users, it was associated with an immediate drop in positive emotions such as joy and a surge in outrage, political polarization, and boredom. -utoronto.ca</p>
        <h2>The downfall of Threads by Meta</h2>
        <p>
Meta's Threads app, launched in July 2023, i had a surge in popularity, quickly gaining over 100 million users. However, it soon faced a significant decline. Here are some key reasons for its downfall:
<br><br>
1. <b>Limited Functionality</b>: Threads lacked many features that made Instagram popular, such as filters, editing tools, and stickers. This limited its appeal compared to its parent app.
<br><br>
2. <b>Lack of Innovation</b>: Despite a few new features, Threads failed to innovate and add exciting capabilities over time. This led to a loss of user interest.
<br><br>
3. <b>User Retention Issues</b>: Threads struggled with retaining users. Daily active users dropped by over 80% within a few months.
<br><br>
4. <b>Competition</b>: Other social media platforms like Snapchat and Twitter continued to dominate, making it difficult for Threads to establish a solid user base.
<br><br>
Despite its initial success, these factors contributed to Threads' inability to sustain its user base and led to its downfall. With Mrwhosetheboss giving Threads a 8/10 fail</p>
        <h2>What makes Bluesky Better?</h2>
        <p>

Bluesky is better than Twitter and Threads because it not owned by some massive tech company or some billionaire. Mainly because Bluesky has a user base of just 3.2 million users (about the population of Arkansas). If bluesky blows up and gains a user base right around twitter, then the people who runed Twitter will ruin Bluesky to.

Some more key points why Bluesky is better:
<br><br>
1. <b>Features</b>: Bluesky has most of the same features of Threads and Twitter but has some features that only Bluesky has for example: Starter Packs
<br><br>
2. <b>Intergration</b>: Bluesky has an open source and easy to use API to build and develop apps.
<br><br>
3. <b>Growth</b>: One of the main issues with Therads is the slow growth on the platform. I joined Bluesky and on Monday and posted every day at 9:30 EST i have gained 11 followers in the past 14 days.
<br><br>
With all of this said this is just my opinion you can chose to use Bluesky, Threads or Twitter. I don't care.</p>
