        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>MBD or Made By Danny is a small site Made By Danny that started on May 10 2024 by a 12 year-old kid named Danny. I (Danny) loved tech. I wanted to learn to code websites (HTML) . I found a short show on a Microsoft site then expanded to W3Schools and youtube where Techno Time showed me how to use Cloudflare. The story has just begun.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why UK?</h2>
        <p>You might be asking why Made By Danny UK, that's because I am British and because Cloudflare .uk domains are cheaper. Mainly because madebydanny.com was taken. And I like the sound of "Made By Danny UK" it stands out.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>MBD + Cloudflare</h2>
        <p>In my blog I mention Cloudflare alot but what is it
“Cloudflare started as a simple application to find the source of email spam. From there it grew into a service that protects websites from all manner of attacks, while simultaneously optimizing performance.” -https://www.cloudflare.com/about-overview/
I Love it and it’s free. That's why our websites are fast why simple things like being able to check the weather from our homepage is possible why madebydanny.uk is so cheap why we can build a better internet why we can say “Performance and Security By Cloudflare” why we can handle attacks everyday and not worry about it, why we can keep MBD Free because Cloudflare is Free. Here at MBD we Love Cloudflare.</p>
